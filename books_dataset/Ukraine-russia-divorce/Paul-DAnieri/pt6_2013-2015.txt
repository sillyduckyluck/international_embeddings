On the evening of November 21, 2013, following the announcement that Ukraine was suspending discussions over the EU Association Agreement (AA), a few thousand protesters gathered on the Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square), the main site of protests going back to 1990. Calls went out over social media for a bigger protest the next Sunday, November 24; and an estimated 100,000 people turned out to protest. When a small group of protesters sought to break through a police cordon surrounding government buildings, police fired tear gas and arrested several of them.1

The situation calmed for a few days, and Prime Minister Nikolai Azarov insisted that negotiations with the European Union would continue. But the Vilnius summit ended on November 29 with no progress.

That evening, about ten thousand protesters turned out in Kyiv. Most went home, but a few remained in place overnight. At 4:00 the next morning the Interior Ministry’s elite Berkut forces attacked using batons and stun grenades, arresting several protesters. This attack began the escalation that turned an issue-specific protest into a contest over the future of the Yanukovych regime, ultimately leading Yanukovych to flee the country three months later, providing the opportunity and excuse for Russia’s seizure of Crimea and intervention in eastern Ukraine.

Had Ukraine not come so close to signing the agreement, it is unlikely that its failure would have spurred such a reaction, but the long-running question of releasing Tymoshenko seemed to have been resolved and it appeared that the deal was set to be signed, so the subsequent step back from it was seen as a loss and, as we have stressed, people react very strongly to perceived losses. Moreover, there was a sense that Yanukovych’s behavior, bad as it had been, had been moderated by the process of negotiating the AA, and that with the agreement now dead, he would feel unconstrained.2 The harsh repressions of November 30 heightened 1 BBC, “Huge Rally over EU Agreement Delay,” November 24, 2013.

the sense that Ukraine was undergoing an irreversible shift toward authoritarianism and away from Europe. Even so, the protests were initially very small

How did protests over the Association Agreement lead to the deposing of an elected government and then to war? There are two broad answers to this question. The first is that the context had, over the previous twenty-two years and especially since Yanukovych’s inauguration, turned Ukrainian politics, Ukraine-Russian relations, and Russia’s relations with the West into zero-sum games, with the room for mutually acceptable compromise narrowed. The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, stated at the height of the crisis that “the developments in Ukraine will decide the history and the future of the whole region.”3 The second is that Yanukovych’s responses to the conflict ‒ a mix of repression that enraged the protesters and forbearance that empowered them ‒ could scarcely have been better designed to see protests endure and the demands of protesters escalate. Yanukovych had sought to learn the lessons of 2004, but ended up producing a manual on how to turn small protests into disaster.

The overthrow of Yanukovych created both threats and opportunities for Russia: the threat was to Russia’s deep-seated commitment to controlling Ukraine, to its goal of keeping NATO from expanding further eastward, and to Putin’s immunity to protests in Russia. But it also created the opportunity to kill four birds with one stone. Seizing Crimea and intervening in the Donbas regained territory that Russia had always wanted; it showed that Russia could defy the West with impunity; it boosted Vladimir Putin’s domestic popularity; and it hamstrung Ukraine’s new government.

This chapter chronicles and seeks to explain these two processes ‒

from protests to “revolution” and from intervention to partly frozen conflict ‒ with Putin’s decision to seize Crimea as the pivotal event.

For all the problems of the previous decades, almost no one in 2013 anticipated that something like this would happen. While it is tempting in retrospect to see the outcome as inevitable, it clearly was not.

The Emergence of Protest: November‒December 2013

When the Berkut attacked protesters on the Maidan in the early morning of November 30, several dozen protesters retreated uphill to the St. Michael’s Monastery.4 By the evening of November 30, there 3 Steven Lee Myers, “Violence in Ukraine Creates Deepening Clash between East and West,” New York Times, February 19, 2014.

were an estimated ten thousand protesters on St. Michael’s Square and many more were on the way. The protesters began organizing the “self-defense” units that were to play a growing role in subsequent events.

The police violence of November 30 was crucial in spurring the protest movement. A movement against police brutality and authoritarianism drew much broader support than did one against the suspension of the AA negotiations. The scholar Volodymyr Ishchenko recalled: At first, I was very skeptical, especially when it was so purely a “Euromaidan” ‒

I couldn’t be so uncritical of the EU … But then, when the attempt at a crackdown took place in the early morning of 30 November, the character of the protests changed ‒ this was now a movement against police brutality and against the government.5

The authorities’ mix of coercion and accommodation served to enrage protesters and increase their numbers without either deterring them or preventing access to the main protest sites. Interior Minister Vitaly Zakharchenko first criticized the Berkut, saying that they had abused their power, but then said that “if there are calls for mass disturbances, then we will react to this harshly.”6 Having cleared the Maidan and forced protesters to relocate to St. Michael’s square (see Map 7.1), the authorities then allowed them to reoccupy the Maidan. Access to the Maidan was subsequently controlled by the protesters, not the government, which focused on protecting government buildings nearby.

The electricity remained on in the Maidan, supplies came in and waste out, cell phone networks operated, and the Kyiv metro continued to run, including at two stops inside the protest zone. The combination of repression and accommodation helped the protests grow.

There was disunity not only among the groups on the Maidan, but between the Maidan as a whole and the opposition political parties Batkivshchyna, UDAR, and Svoboda. Many protesters considered the opposition parties to be part of the corrupt system that they wanted to end. While extreme nationalists were a very small minority in the large demonstrations, their persistent presence, willingness to face violence from the security forces, and readiness to use direct action themselves, useful list of the key personnel, see Sonya Koshkina, Maidan: Nerasskazannaya Istoriya (Kyiv: Bright Star Publishing, 2015).

gave them disproportionate influence. The mainstream protesters and parties could have denounced the extreme nationalist groups or refused to collaborate with them, but they could not exclude them from the Maidan or control them. One important victory for nationalists was that the traditional nationalist slogan “Glory to the Heroes!” [Heroyam Slava!], which had roots in the controversial World War II-era Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and Ukrainian Insurgent Army, was adopted by the mainstream of the protest movement, becoming a routine response to the more traditional and less controversial Slava Ukrayini!

(Glory to Ukraine).7 This undoubtedly fed the perception that extreme nationalists dominated the Maidan.

The aims of the protesters varied, and they evolved over time, as shown by the competing labels for the upheaval well after it took place. Some 7 Ishchenko provides one of the more nuanced discussions of the role of nationalists on the Maidan. See also Volodymyr Ishchenko, “Far Right Participation in the Ukrainian Maidan Protests: An Attempt of Systematic Estimation,” European Politics and Society 17, 4 (2016): 453‒472.

called it the “Euromaidan,” emphasizing the EU Association Agreement.

Others called it the “Revolution of Dignity,” focusing on frustration with petty corruption and Yanukovych’s repression of protesters. Until mid-January 2014, most protesters sought not to depose Yanukovych, but to get the AA signed, to protest corruption, to reassert Ukraine’s democracy and to ensure that the 2015 presidential election would be fair. One concrete goal on which many agreed was the reinstatement of the 2004

constitution, which Yanukovych had illegally modified.8

Yanukovych Looks to Russia

Having shunned the EU, Yanukovych had no option but to take what Russia offered and claim victory. On December 17, 2013 he traveled to Moscow and received his reward for jettisoning the AA. He and Putin agreed on a nearly 50 percent discount on Russian gas and a $15 billion loan that would allow Ukraine to avoid default without a deal with the IMF and the reforms it would require. This was especially important because the unrest underway in Kyiv caused fears of a fall in the value of the hryvnya that would exacerbate Ukraine’s payments problem.9

Prime Minister Azarov stated that “The president reached agreement on exceptionally beneficial conditions for crediting Ukraine’s economy, which allows us to carry out wide-ranging plans for economic modernization.”10 Putin, recognizing how sensitive the Customs Union was in Ukraine at that moment, reassured its opponents that the union had not been discussed in his meeting with Yanukovych.11 Work on it must have continued, however, because in January Ukraine’s Cabinet of Ministers adopted a “program of cooperation with the members of the Customs Union through 2020.”12

From mid-December 2013 until mid-January 2014, the conflict ebbed, in part due to the holidays. It appeared that a waiting game would pit the patience of Yanukovych against the endurance of protesters camped outdoors in the Ukrainian winter. By mid-January, hundreds rather than thousands of protesters remained camped on the Maidan.

At this point general opinion was that “the protests do not appear to have threatened Yanukovich’s grip on power.”13

Again, however, the government took a step that provoked widespread anger and reenergized the protests. On January 16, the pro-Yanukovych majority in the Rada pushed through a series of laws outlawing particular protest tactics and curtailing the activities of foreign NGOs. The laws were voted on by a show of hands, in contravention of the parliament’s rules, and votes were counted for deputies who were absent, leading some to call the act a “coup.”14 Interior Minister Zakharchenko, echoing language he had used at the beginning of the crisis, said that “every offense will be met on our side by a tough response within the framework of the current legislation.”15 The laws quickly became known collectively as “the dictatorship laws.” Ukraine’s democracy appeared to be at stake.

On January 19, thousands of protesters, outraged by the “dictatorship laws,” confronted security forces protecting government buildings.16

The ensuing violence further radicalized the protests. As a result of the

“dictatorship laws” and the violence of January 19, opinion among the protesters began to solidify around a set of new demands. These included the release and amnesty of arrested protesters, the reversal of the January 16 laws, and reversion to the 2004 version of the constitution. Many now called for Yanukovych’s resignation.

The following week, Yanukovych met with Batkivshchyna leader Arseniy Yatseniuk and offered to appoint Yatsenyuk prime minister and Vitaliy Klitschko deputy prime minister for humanitarian issues.

He also offered to reconsider the “dictatorship laws.” Yatseniuk insisted that he was willing to negotiate, but also said that signing the EU

Association Agreement was a key demand. No agreement was reached at this time and, as became apparent later, it is not clear that Yatsenyuk had any mandate to negotiate on behalf of protestors. Yanukovych put the opposition parties in a difficult position. An agreement was necessary to end the crisis, but negotiating to join Yanukovych’s government would undermine their credibility.

On January 28, Yanukovych fired Prime Minister Azarov and the parliament reversed several of the “dictatorship laws” While these concessions were cheered on the Maidan, they did little to defuse the 13 “Ukrainian President Approves Strict Anti-protest Laws,” The Guardian, January 17, 2014.

protests.17 The protesters were seeking repeal of all the “dictatorship laws” as well as returning to the 2004 constitution and signing the AA.

While protesters increasingly rejected compromise with Yanukovych, they had no way to put more pressure on him other than turning to violence, which most still rejected.

In late January and early February, two seemingly contradictory trends coexisted. On one hand, negotiations between the Yanukovych regime and opposition leaders appeared to be making progress. On the other, the likelihood of violence was increasing. The threat of violence may have spurred Yanukovych to seek a compromise, but it also empowered the more extremist protesters.18 On January 21‒22, three protesters were killed by police.19 A protest on February 2 drew an estimated fifty thousand people to the Maidan, rather than the several hundred thousand that took part in December. That may have emboldened Yanukovych while concentrating the influence of the more militant among the protesters.

The Russian government advocated ending the protests forcibly.

Putin’s advisor on Ukraine issues, Sergei Glazyev, said in an interview that “In a situation when the authorities encounter a coup attempt, they simply have no choice [but to use force]. Otherwise the country will be plunged into chaos.” Accusing the United States of arming Ukrainian protesters and training them at the US embassy in Kyiv, Glazyev went on to say that under the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, Russia was obliged to intervene to prevent such a threat to Ukraine’s sovereignty.20

Reuters reported that Russia was withholding a $2 billion loan until the protesters were cleared from the Maidan.21

In early February, Batkivshchyna party leader Arseniy Yatseniuk continued negotiating with Yanukovych, saying that he would agree to become prime minister, with Yanukovych remaining president, if the 2004 constitution were reinstated and if a government of opposition figures was appointed with assurances that they would not soon be fired.

“We have a short- and a long-term plan. The long-term plan foresees the preparation of a new Constitution draft and its adoption by September.

Our short-term prospective is to achieve the return to the Constitution 17 “Ukraine Crisis: Parliament Abolishes Anti-protest Law,” BBC.com, January 28, 2014.

of 2004 as a temporary decision until we adopt a new Constitution.”22

At this point, constitutional reform and a change of course, not the ouster of Yanukovych, were still the main goals of the mainstream opposition, but support for Yanukovych’s resignation was growing.

Progress was also made on the protesters’ demand for the release of arrested protesters. On February 14‒16, a compromise was reached in which the government released 234 prisoners arrested since December, and protesters vacated city hall and other buildings, and some of the barricades around the Maidan were breached.

On February 18, however, progress toward a peaceful settlement collapsed. An estimated twenty thousand protesters marched on the parliament building to push for reinstitution of the 2004 Constitution.

They were confronted by security forces using live ammunition, rubber bullets, tear gas, and flash grenades. Some of the protesters were also using firearms. At 4:00 pm, The Interior Ministry and SBU announced that “If by 6 p.m. the disturbances have not ended, we will be obliged to restore order by all means envisaged by law.”23 The ensuing attack by police pushed the protesters back onto the Maidan, where barricades finally held. By the day’s end, at least eighteen people were dead, including several members of the security forces. The violence of February 18 caused both sides to harden their positions, even as government and opposition leaders frantically sought to avoid further bloodshed.

After this violence in Kyiv, the use of force also increased in other cities where demonstrations had been taking place. In several western Ukrainian cities, people occupied regional administration buildings, attacked police stations and seized weapons. Ukraine was approaching a situation in which both protesters and government forces would be wielding firearms. Equally important, the seizing of local police stations and administration buildings all over Ukraine initiated a tactic that was to be turned against the anti-Yanukovych movement very quickly after he fell.

On the evening of February 19, the foreign ministers of France (Laurent Fabius), Germany (Frank-Walter Steinmeier), and Poland (Radoslaw Sikorski negotiated with Yanukovych for several hours, trying to find a compromise that would avert more violence. However, Yanukovych would not accept the demand for early elections, which protesters saw as a compromise from their demand that he step down immediately. While scheduled elections were, by this time, only a year 22 “Yatseniuk Ready to Head Cabinet of Ministers, but Only if It Consists of Opposition,”

away, the opposition feared that Yanukovych would use any respite to clamp down further and to rig the election.

Early on February 20, protesters attacked a police line at the south-eastern end of the Maidan. Interior Minister Zakharchenko announced that he had signed a decree authorizing security forces to use live ammunition against the protesters.24 After protesters broke through a police line, the police opened fire, both from on the ground and from sniper positions. By day’s end, another roughly seventy protesters had been killed and over five hundred wounded, and several more security forces had been killed.25 The UN later reported a total of 108 protesters and 13 law enforcement officials in Kyiv from November to February.26

There is considerable speculation concerning who was shooting at whom on February 20. There have been allegations that a “third force”

was shooting at both sides, trying to spur on the conflict, from high in the Hotel Ukraina, overlooking Instytutska Street and the Maidan. Some point to Georgians, some to Ukrainians, and some to Russians. The chaos of the day and the intense efforts at disinformation that have ensued have made it impossible to disconfirm these theories. The most sophisticated effort to address the issue, carried out at Carnegie Mellon University, found conclusively that at least some of the protestors on Instytutska Street were killed by Berkut forces on the ground.27

The violence of February 20 demolished the government’s legitimacy in the eyes of many in Ukraine, and increased people’s resolve that Yanukovych had to resign. It had the same effect in the West, which previously had sought to broker solutions that would have kept him in office. Even more important, as it became clear that Yanukovych might lose power, his supporters began hedging their bets or simply abandoning him. Beginning with Kyiv Mayor Volodymyr Makayenko, Party of Regions officials began announcing their defection from the party. They were likely appalled by the violence, and were also probably determined to retain their positions once power shifted. The fear that they might be confronted by protesters without the security forces to protect them would have underscored their decisions.

From Revolution to War, 2013–2015

On the night of February 20‒21, Yanukovych belatedly came to an agreement with the three main opposition party leaders. The deal was brokered by the foreign ministers of France, Germany, and Poland, along with Russia, which sent human rights ombudsman Vladimir Lukin, apparently at Yanukovych’s request. The deal included a return to the 2004 constitution, formation of a “unity government” including opposition members, and early elections, in return for the protesters leaving occupied streets and buildings. A ceremony was held in which the opposition party leaders and Yanukovych, along with the three western foreign ministers, signed the agreement and shook hands. Though Putin was later to excoriate the West for the deal’s abandonment, Russia decided not to sign it.

The terms negotiated may have garnered support from protesters a few days earlier (when Yanukovych rejected them) but after the violence of February 20, Yanukovych’s resignation was now a nonnegotiable demand for many. In a meeting with the coordinating council of the Maidan, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski urged the protest leaders to accept the deal. “If you don’t support this deal you will have martial law, the army. You will all be dead.”28 The group reluctantly agreed to back the deal by a vote of 34‒2.29

When Vitaliy Klitschko appeared on the stage at the Maidan to announce the deal the next evening, February 21, however, the crowd vocally opposed it. Volodymyr Parasiuk, a twenty-six-year-old leader of one of the “self-defense” groups that had been engaged in the bloody battle the day before, took the stage to denounce the deal and to issue an ultimatum: if Yanukovych did not resign by 10:00 am the next day, the protesters would start taking government buildings by force.30 This met with the crowd’s approval. The protesters on the Maidan thus rebuked the opposition party leaders, rejected the agreement that many hoped had resolved the crisis, and upped the ante. The violence of February 20 had not frightened the protesters, but rather enraged them and steeled their will to finish the job. While the security forces retreated, the protesters expanded the territory under their control and strengthened their barricades.

When the Ukrainian parliament met on the afternoon of February 21, many of the Party of Regions deputies and Communist Party deputies did not show up for the session, leaving parliament in control of the opposition and recent defectors. The parliament passed a measure 28 Roland Oliphant and Shannon Strange, “Ukraine Protest Leaders Warned: ‘Sign Deal or You Will All Die’,” The Telegraph, February 21, 2013.

on returning to the 2004 constitution, decriminalized the acts under which Yuliya Tymoshenko had been imprisoned and amnestied those arrested during the protests. It also fired Interior Minister Zakharchenko and forbade the armed forces from attacking the protesters. While Yanukovych had agreed to some of these measures, the parliament had essentially turned on him, as Party of Regions members announced that they were leaving the party. It was reported that many of these deputies had abandoned Kyiv, along with other Party of Regions leaders. Yanukovych himself had left the city after signing the agreement with the opposition leaders.

Seeing Yanukovych’s political support eroding, security forces abandoned their posts in large numbers. Several thousand were escorted out by protesters; many others simply left. Polish Foreign Minister Sikorski, who had warned the protesters of a violent crackdown, called this development “astonishing.”31 The Yanukovych government was collapsing, leaving a vacuum. Yanukovych left Kyiv, apparently for a previously scheduled meeting, strengthening the perception that he had been defeated. Late that night, Yanukovych left Kyiv for Kharkiv, and for a time it was not clear exactly where he was.

The next day, February 22, Speaker of the Parliament Rybak resigned, claiming to be ill. The parliament declared that Yanukovych had abandoned his office.32 On those grounds it elected Oleksandr Turchynov of the Batkivshchyna party as acting president, and scheduled presidential elections for May 25. While Yanukovych was effectively ousted, he was removed without going through the constitutionally prescribed impeachment process, which would involve several steps, including a vote by three-quarters of the total membership of the parliament. The shortcuts taken led many to see the ouster as flawed or even illegitimate, and were grounds for the charge, made by Putin and by some western critics, that the events of February 21‒22 constituted a “coup.”33

In Kharkiv on February 22, Yanukovych recorded an address denouncing the steps taken to remove him and declared that he would not resign.34 He apparently tried to travel from there to Russia by air, but 31 “Poland’s Crucial Role as Yanukovych’s Rule Crumbled,” BBC.com, February 25, 2014.

was denied permission. Instead, he traveled by car to Donetsk and on to Crimea, where Russian forces took him to Russia in the evening of the same day.35 As became clear later, he had begun preparations to leave Kyiv on February 19, before the worst day of violence, before he signed the deal with opposition leaders that would have kept him in power at least until new elections, and before the ultimatum from the Maidan.36

The way that the protests ended played an important role in the composition of the interim government. The most important spots in the new government, including that of prime minister, were held by Tymoshenko’s Batkivshchyna party, but because the far-right groups had played a central role in forcing Yanukovych from power, they successfully demanded several spots in the new government. The willingness of the mainstream parties to ally with the far-right groups was cited by both Russian and western critics as evidence of the illegitimate nature of new government and of the threat to Russians in Ukraine.

Among the first measures passed by the post-Yanukovych parliament was a reversal of the 2012 language law. To head off controversy, Interim President Oleksandr Turchynov refused to sign the new law, leaving the 2012 law in place, but this was not widely reported. Instead, the attempt was reported as a sign that an aggressive nationalist agenda would be pushed. This view was spread widely by Russian media, and fit with the narrative that Ukraine had been taken over by right-wing extremists.

While in substance the reversal of the law was not far-reaching, and symbolically it was very important to many of those who had supported the protests, it was a tactical blunder, feeding the narrative that Russia and Yanukovych (who was now in Russia) were promoting.37

Reaction in Russia and the West

Russia and the West took diametrically opposed positions on the crisis in Ukraine. Although the United States and European Union struggled to coordinate their actions, their approaches were largely compatible with each other. Both the United States and most EU members were much more sympathetic to the protesters than to Yanukovych, and they all strongly rejected the use of violence by either side. Both sought to broker a compromise that would stop the violence and trade an end to protests for concessions by Yanukovych. If there was a difference in approach, it 35 See “Tropamy Yanukovycha. Poslednye dny eks-presydenta v Ukraine glazamy ego okhrannykov. Rekonstruktsyya,” Strana.UA, January 18, 2018.

37 A new, highly controversial language law was passed in 2019.

Reaction in Russia and the West

223

was that some US politicians more clearly seemed to be supporting the overthrow of Yanukovych, and were less inclined to worry about what Russia thought.

From the early days of the demonstrations in December, western leaders supported the protests. The speaker of Lithuania’s parliament Loreta Graužinienė and Polish parliamentarian Marcin Święcicki spoke to the crowd on November 26 and 27, and several EU ambassadors greeted the protesters who amassed in St. Michael’s square on November 30. While Barack Obama remained silent until the Crimea operation began at the end of February, his administration clearly supported the protesters. On December 10, Secretary of State John Kerry spoke of the US government’s “disgust with the decision of Ukrainian authorities to meet the peaceful protest … with riot police, bulldozers, and batons, rather than with respect for democratic rights and human dignity.” “The United States stands with the people of Ukraine. They deserve better.”38

The following day, Victoria Nuland, assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, appeared on the Maidan and met with protesters, a visit seen as highly symbolic of US support. That was reinforced when two US senators, Republican John McCain and Democrat Chris Murphy, visited protesters on the Maidan the following weekend.

McCain told the protesters: “We are here to support your just cause, the sovereign right of Ukraine to determine its own destiny freely and independently. And the destiny you seek lies in Europe.”39

While the European Union was clearly frustrated with the Ukrainian government, it continued to try to complete negotiation of the Association Agreement, finally giving up only in mid-December. The Guardian quoted a “senior EU diplomat” as saying. “I don’t think Yanukovych will sign the accords. It’s blackmail actually. He’s saying he will only sign if he gets a lot of money. He’s trying to maneuver between [the EU and Russia], to get money or concessions. He’s trying to avoid reforms, but the EU agreements are all about reforms.”40

Most EU leaders were also supportive of the protesters’ aims, and especially of their right to protest. The British foreign secretary, William Hague, said that “It is inspiring to see these people standing up for their vision of the future of Ukraine: a free, sovereign, democratic country with much closer ties to the European Union and a positive relationship of 38 “Top U.S. Official Visits Protesters in Kiev as Obama Admin.

mutual respect with Russia. This is a vision I share.” While saying that he recognized Russia’s “strong and legitimate interests in stable relationships with its neighbors,” he said that “Russia cannot dictate terms to them … This is not a zero-sum game: the choice is not either Russia or the EU. It’s about Ukraine finding its true, stable place in the politics of Europe.”41

When Yanukovych, in January 2014, was seeking a compromise that would bring leaders of opposition parties into the parliament, the United States strove to get the opposition leaders to go along and was trying to bring in others, including the UN, to encourage this. The United States hoped that Arseniy Yatseniuk, rather than Vitaliy Klitschko, would become the new prime minister, apparently due to Yatseniuk’s greater economic expertise. It also wanted to keep the far-right Svoboda leader Oleh Tyahnybok out of the government.42 This was much the same deal that the EU foreign ministers sought to negotiate with Yanukovych after the February 18 violence. Despite Nuland’s complaints about the EU, the European Union and United States were advancing very compatible positions. Later, western leaders were aligned again in blaming Yanukovych, not the protesters, for the violence of February 18‒20. In the aftermath of the February 18 violence, both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande blamed the violence on Yanukovych, for his unwillingness to support a compromise.43 Both the European Union and United States enacted a visa ban and asset freeze on government officials in the “full chain of command” responsible for the February 18 crackdown.44

Russia took a very different approach, with Putin’s spokesman saying:

“In the president’s view, all responsibility for what is happening in Ukraine rests with the extremists.”45 It said the protests were illegal and the protesters themselves fascists, warned of the dangers of destabilizing Ukraine, and blamed the West for the protests. Russia used its close relationship with Yanukovych to provide advice and it used its economic leverage ‒ increased since the collapse of talks over the AA ‒ to pressure 41 Quoted in “Ukraine Protests Backed by William Hague,” The Guardian, December 16, 2013.

42 Details of the US position were captured (presumably by Russia) in a cell phone conversation between Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland and Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt. Amidst Nuland’s expletive-laden criticism of the EU, and the tiff that her outburst provoked, US support for a deal that kept Yanukovych in power was largely overlooked.

the Ukrainian government. There is some evidence that the Russian government pressured the Yanukovych government to forcibly repress the protests, but it is unclear how strong such pressure was or what impact it had. More generally, Russia’s position was that Yanukovych and the Ukrainian parliament were legitimately elected, and that protesters should not be able to eject a duly elected government or overturn its policies. Russia was, of course, somewhat flexible in when it insisted on the rule of law in Ukraine and when it did not. It is worth stressing, however, that until Yanukovych fled on February 22, the European Union and United States agreed with Russia that the constitution should be followed. For that reason, western governments supported bringing the opposition into government and revising the constitution, not removing Yanukovych as president.

Yanukovych’s departure drove Russia and the West even further apart.

While Russia, which had not signed the February 20 agreement, accused the West of treachery for not enforcing it, western governments, which had signed the agreement, took Yanukovych’s departure from the country as a fait accompli that made the February 20 agreement irrelevant.

Prime Minister Medvedev said:

If you consider Kalashnikov-toting people in black masks who are roaming Kiev to be the government, then it will be hard for us to work with that government.

Some of our foreign, western partners think otherwise, considering them to be legitimate authorities. I do not know which constitution, which laws they were reading, but it seems to me it is an aberration … Something that is essentially the result of a mutiny is called legitimate.46

The US government, in contrast, issued a statement supporting the

“constructive work” of the parliament and advocated “the prompt formation of a broad, technocratic government of national unity.”47

Russia Seizes Crimea

On February 20, the worst day of violence in Kyiv, the speaker of the Crimean parliament, Vladimir Konstantinov, who was in Moscow, spoke of the possibility that Crimea could secede.48 According to the medal later given by the Russian government to participants in the takeover of 46 Ian Traynor, “Russia Denounces Ukraine ‘Terrorists’ and West over Yanukovich Ousting,” The Guardian, February 24, 2014.

Crimea, the operation began the same day. This was two days before Yanukovych fled. Daniel Treisman asserts, based on interviews with leaders in Moscow, that Russian troops in Novorossiysk, Russia and in Sevastopol were put on alert on February 18, and were given orders to begin “peacekeeping” operations on February 20.49

In various cities in Crimea, demonstrations were held both for and against the Maidan protests. After Yanukovych’s departure on February 22, some protesters called for secession. On February 26, groups of pro-Russian and pro-Maidan demonstrators faced off in Sevastopol. Konstantinov declared that day that Crimea would remain part of Ukraine, and that statements to the contrary were “a provocation.”50

In the early hours of February 27, sixty heavily armed men seized the buildings of the Crimean parliament and Council of Ministers, and raised Russian flags. A meeting of some parliament members was then held, and allegedly voted to replace the Crimean prime minister, Anatoly Mogilev, with the pro-Russian Sergei Aksyonov. Whether there was a quorum present and how the vote went are unknown, because the gunmen limited access to the building and confiscated lawmakers’ cell-phones. Mogilev himself was not allowed in, and at least one lawmaker reported that his vote was recorded even though he was not in Simferopol.51 Aksyonov, also known as “Goblin,” was associated with an organized crime group52 and led the Russian Unity party in Crimea, which had never won more than a few percent in elections. This meeting also announced a referendum on May 25 on expanding Crimean autonomy.

That same morning, units of the Berkut, which had been dissolved by the Ukrainian parliament on February 25, seized strategic crossings on the Isthmus of Perekop that links Crimea to the rest of Ukraine. It is unclear who ordered or coordinated these movements, which included heavy equipment such as armed personnel carriers.

The operation to seize Crimea became much more visible on February 28, when soldiers in unmarked uniforms, later widely known as “little green men,” seized the airports in Simferopol and Sevastopol.

While the identity of these soldiers was obscured, there was no doubt 49 Daniel Treisman, The New Autocracy: Information, Politics, and Policy in Putin’s Russia (Washington, DC: Brookings Institution, 2018), pp. 287‒288.

about the identity of the Russian navy ship that that blockaded the harbor at Balaklava, home to the Ukrainian coast guard.

On March 1, the significance of the installation of Aksyonov as prime minister became clear when he requested Russian intervention: “I call on the president of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, to provide assistance in ensuring peace and tranquility on the territory.”53 This provided the pretext needed for Russia to intervene more openly, and Putin later cited this request in justifying Russian intervention. That same day, Putin formally asked the Federation Council permission for

“using the armed forces of the Russian Federation on the territory of Ukraine until the normalization of the socio-political situation in that country,”54 which the Federation Council approved unanimously hours later. The measure specified “the territory of Ukraine,” not just Crimea, wording that implied a threat that Russia would invade other parts of Ukraine if Ukraine resisted the takeover of Crimea.

Over the next few days, the takeover of Crimea by Russian forces proceeded quickly.55 The operation appeared to be well choreographed and Ukrainian defenses collapsed. Two factors made a military defense impossible. One was that the speed and surprise of the operation caught Ukrainian forces off guard, so that even those inclined to fight found themselves confronted by superior forces. The second was that most were not inclined to fight. Many Ukrainian military units in Crimea surrendered or switched sides en masse. Units in Crimea were staffed mainly by soldiers from Crimea. Many of the officers were veterans of the Soviet armed forces who had been skeptical about Ukrainian independence from the beginning.

Governmental chaos in Kyiv further improved the conditions for the takeover of Crimea. The change of government bolstered the claim, legally specious but politically effective, that the nonconstitutionality of Yanukovych’s departure in Kyiv somehow justified invading and annexing Ukraine’s territory. Equally important was that the Ukrainian government was in chaos, and therefore unable to respond effectively. While Turchynov had been appointed acting president on February 22, the entire top stratum of the government had been Yanukovych loyalists, and 53 “Ukraine Crisis: Crimea Leader Appeals to Putin for Help,” BBC.com, March 1, 2014.

228

From Revolution to War, 2013–2015

they fled, were ousted, resigned, or supported Russia. On March 1, Acting President Turchynov appointed Denis Berezovsky as commander of the Ukrainian navy. The next day, Berezovsky pledged his allegiance to Crimea, and a few weeks later he was made deputy commander of the Russian Black Sea Fleet.56

On March 4, Putin gave a press conference at which he stated that the forces in Ukraine were not Russian, but were rather local Crimean forces.57 He also said that Russia retained the right to use “all means”

to address “anarchy” in its neighbor. On March 6, the Crimean parliament voted to seek accession to the Russian Federation and moved up the referendum date to March 16.

A stunned world watched and complained but could do very little.

Representatives from the OSCE, United Nations, and European Union documented their inability to enter Crimea to conduct missions there.

The G7 said it would not recognize the results of the referendum, and urged Russia to do whatever it could to stop it. Russia instead began a new series of previously unannounced military exercises near the Ukrainian border in the vicinity of Kharkiv. Ukrainian policy makers later indicated that one reason they did not resist the annexation is that they feared a broader invasion that they were in no position to repel.58

The referendum was held on March 16. Voters were offered two choices, neither of which was to maintain the existing situation: 1 Are you in favor of the reunification of Crimea with Russia as a part of the Russian Federation?

2 Are you in favor of restoring the 1992 Constitution and the status of Crimea as a part of Ukraine?59

While there were no international observers and few journalists on hand to document the conditions of the referendum, the turnout and vote figures that were released officially, 83 percent turnout with 95.5

percent in favor of annexation by Russia, were almost certainly false.

Yevgeny Bobrov of the Russian President’s Council on the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights wrote that the numbers were likely 56 “New Head of Ukraine’s Navy Defects in Crimea,” BBC.com, March 2, 2014.

57 Putin both denied that there were Russian forces in Crimea and explained why their deployment was justified. These positions were contradictory, but his approach seems to have been to cover all possible objections.

58 This view was conveyed in several interviews with Ukrainian leaders in Kyiv in May 2018.

59 Noah Sneider, “2 Choices in Crimea Referendum, but Neither Is ‘No’,” New York Times, March 14, 2014. The 1992 constitution had been adopted by the Crimean parliament but rejected by Kyiv. Implementing it would have made Crimea an independent part of Ukraine, likely facilitating further moves toward secession.

much lower: “In the opinion of practically all of the interviewed special-ists and citizens: The overwhelming majority of the residents of Sevastopol voted in the referendum for joining Russia (with a turnout of 50‒80%), and in Crimea [outside Sevastopol], according to various data 50‒60% of voters for joining Russia, with an overall turnout of 30‒

50%.”60

Given the widespread view that most Crimeans supported annexation to Russia, it is not clear why Russia did not sponsor a more orderly referendum and allow international observers and journalists to witness it. Subsequent polling by international firms indicated that most Crimeans said that they agreed with the outcome of the referendum.

However, polling conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, shortly before the fall of Yanukovych and seizure of Crimea, put support for joining Russia much lower: 41 percent in Crimea, 33 percent in Donetsk, 24 percent in Luhansk and Odesa oblasts, and 13 percent nationwide.61 One interpretation is that after annexation people hesitated to say they opposed it. Another is that the ouster of Yanukovych increased Crimeans’ support for annexation to Russia.

On March 17 the Crimean parliament requested annexation to the Russian Federation, and on March 18 a treaty of accession was signed which brought Crimea and Sevastopol into the Russian Federation as two distinct subjects. On March 21, the Federal Assembly ratified the treaty and Putin signed it into law. Crimea was annexed. All in all, the process took just over three weeks from the appearance of the “little green men” at Simferopol airport, and just under four weeks from Yanukovych’s departure from Kyiv.

The organization, speed, and efficiency with which the operation was conducted leads to the conclusion that the operation was planned well in advance. That observation, however, leaves many questions unanswered.

First, when was the decision to seize the territory actually taken? Were the plans that were executed in February‒March 2014 simply contingency plans, as many militaries have for many possible eventualities, or had the decision to seize Crimea had been made much earlier, with only the timing to be determined by the advent of a good opportunity?

Treisman points out that while the military part of the operation seemed well prepared and ran very smoothly, the political arrangements, 60 Yevgeny Bobrov, “Problemy Zhitelei Kryma,” Blogi Chlenov Sovieta, Sovyet pri Prezidente Rossiiskoi Federatsii po razvitiyu grazhdanskogo obshchestva I pravam cheloveka,

including who would be in charge in Crimea and whether Crimea would seek autonomy or to join Russia, seemed chaotic and improvised.

He infers from this that the invasion was primarily driven by the goal of preserving control over the naval base in Sevastopol.62 In Kyiv, many attribute this mix of military efficiency and political improvisation to a Russian assumption that protests against Yanukovych would not take place until the 2015 presidential election; hence Russia was only partly prepared. This perspective fits with the even more improvised subsequent actions in eastern Ukraine.

The date on the medals given to participants in the annexation indicates that the operation started on February 20, at which time Yanukovych was still in power in Kyiv. Consistent with that, Putin said later in a documentary on the takeover that the decision was made by a tight circle of advisors in the closing days of the Sochi Olympic Games (which ended on February 23). If we take the date February 20 seriously, we must consider two different striking conclusions. One possibility is that Putin already knew on February 20 that Yanukovych would flee Ukraine. That fits with video recovered from Yanukovych’s residence that showed his aides packing up at that time, but his packing could merely have been a precaution. Another possibility is that the decision to seize Crimea came before Yanukovych’s downfall, and therefore was not caused by it.

A third alternative, however, must also be considered: that the date on the medals was put there for some other reason that has nothing to do with when the decision to annex Crimea was taken. What is clear, however, is that the notion that the seizure of Crimea was simply a spontaneous reaction to Yanukovych’s ouster is extremely difficult to square with the timing of the operation and the incredible smoothness with which it was pulled off. At a minimum, Russia had made plans for the military seizure of Crimea well in advance.

The West Responds on Crimea

Stunned western leaders unanimously criticized Russia’s invasion. On March 1, Obama spoke directly with Putin. According to the White House statement on the call:

President Obama spoke for 90 minutes this afternoon with President Putin of Russia about the situation in Ukraine. President Obama expressed his deep concern over Russia’s clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial 62 Treisman, The New Autocracy: Information, chapter 11.

The West Responds on Crimea

231

integrity, which is a breach of international law, including Russia’s obligations under the UN Charter, and of its 1997 military basing agreement with Ukraine, and which is inconsistent with the 1994 Budapest Memorandum and the Helsinki Final Act. The United States condemns Russia’s military intervention into Ukrainian territory.63

Russia released its own version of the Obama-Putin call:

Vladimir Putin drew his attention to the provocative and criminal actions on the part of ultranationalists who are in fact being supported by the current authorities in Kyiv. The Russian President spoke of a real threat to the lives and health of Russian citizens and the many compatriots who are currently on Ukrainian territory. Vladimir Putin stressed that in case of any further spread of violence to Eastern Ukraine and Crimea, Russia retains the right to protect its interests and the Russian-speaking population of those areas.64

This threat was effective, and while western governments expressed outrage, they also urged Ukraine not to do anything that might provide a pretext for further invasion, as had happened with Georgia in 2008. US

Secretary of State Kerry praised Ukraine’s Interim President Turchynov for “showing the utmost restraint,”65 though Ukraine was not in a position to do much. When acting Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk contacted Russian leaders on March 4, he was in the awkward position of not only protesting the intervention in Crimea, but asking whether Russia still intended to provide the $15 billion loan promised to Yanukovych, which Ukraine still needed. Putin, meanwhile, rejected the legitimacy of the interim government.66

The West focused on persuading Russia to change course. An initial step was to announce that they were suspending preparations for the G8

summit planned for Sochi in June. Discussion quickly focused on economic sanctions. On March 17, the day after Crimea’s referendum on joining Russia, the European Union and United States announced sanctions against twenty-one Russian and Ukrainian officials deemed to have taken part in “actions threatening Ukraine’s territorial integrity.”67 The list included the new prime minister of Crimea, Aksyonov, and the speaker of the Crimean parliament, Vladimir Konstantinov, as well as Putin’s advisor on Ukraine Sergei Glazyev. Most observers recognized that sanctions would not compel Russia to relinquish Crimea, but many 63 Steve Wilson, Peter Foster, and Katie Grant, “Ukraine as It Happened,” The Telegraph, March 2, 2014.

argued that they were valuable anyhow as a means of demonstrating unity and resolve and demonstrating that there would be a cost for any future aggression.68

NATO’s Response

On March 2, as the takeover of Crimea was unfolding, the North Atlantic Council convened in Brussels to consider a response. Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said that “What Russia is doing now in Ukraine violates the principles of the United Nations charter. It threatens peace and security in Europe. Russia must stop its military activities and its threats.”69 On March 5, the NATO-Russia Council met, after which Rasmussen announced the suspension of the first planned joint NATO-Russia mission, the suspension of all staff meetings between NATO and Russia, and a review of “the entire range of NATO-Russia cooperation.”

“At the same time, we do want to keep the door open for political dialogue. So we are ready to maintain meetings of ambassadors in the NATO-Russia Council, as we have done today.”70

Over the next few months, NATO agreed on several new force deploy-ments intended to address the threat exposed by Russia’s invasion of Crimea. It had long been recognized that NATO could not repel an invasion of the new members that bordered Russia, but an invasion had been seen as unlikely, and preparing for it would have alienated Russia.

Crimea altered that calculus, kicking the security dilemma into high gear.

NATO and its members now feared not only an invasion, but the potential for this vulnerability to compel concessions to Russia.

At the 2014 Wales summit, therefore, NATO agreed on a set of

“Assurance” and “Adaptive” measures to reassure allies and to give the alliance a better chance to back those assurances up. These measures included increasing rotations of troops through Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, increasing air patrols in the border regions, increasing the “Response Force” to 40,000 troops, and creating a new “Very High Readiness Force” of 5,000 troops that could be deployed within a few days.71 Thus, one side effect of the conflict in Ukraine was a substantial 68 See Daniel W.

increase in NATO activity near Russia’s border, something that Russia had long opposed and NATO had long refrained from.

Intervention in Eastern Ukraine

Russia’s success in Crimea was followed quickly by a more slow-moving operation in eastern Ukraine. It remains unclear to what extent the protests in the east were initiated by local dissatisfaction with the situation in Kyiv, and to what extent they were organized and supported from Russia, and whether the conflict that emerged was a “civil war” or an “invasion” has divided scholars and analysts along predictable lines.

Clearly there were elements of both local separatism and Russian support, and the mix likely differed in different places. The dichotomy being argued over is at least in part a false one.72 Many violent conflicts have elements of both international and civil wars. In Ukraine, the distinction between “internal” and “supported by Russia” has never been clear, because Russia consistently supported and encouraged those in Ukraine who sought closer ties with Russia. Those who supported greater autonomy for eastern regions, and closer relations with Russia, naturally looked to Russia for support, and Russia was eager to provide it.

As time went on, Russia’s direct involvement became harder to deny, and played a growing role in sustaining the anti-Kyiv forces. In places where there was little internal support for separatism, Russian assistance was unable to generate a sustainable movement. But where there was more substantial internal support, Russia was able to provide the organization, intelligence, encouragement, money, and arms to enable relatively small groups to sustain serious challenges to the Ukrainian government. And when the Ukrainian state regrouped and threatened to defeat the separatist movements in August 2014, Russia’s intervention with regular army units was decisive in defeating Ukrainian forces and maintaining the separatist governments of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.

On March 1, as the Crimea operation was progressing, pro-Russia activists occupied regional administration buildings in several eastern and southern Ukrainian regions, but pro-government forces quickly retook control. On April 7, forces occupying the state administration buildings in Donetsk and Kharkiv declared the establishment of the 72 See, for example, David A. Lake, “International Relations Theory and Internal Conflict: Insights from the Interstices,” International Studies Review 5, 4, December 1, 2003, pp. 81–89.

“Donetsk People’s Republic,” and the “Kharkov73 People’s Republic.”

(The “Luhansk People’s Republic” appears to have first been declared by a crowd of separatists outside the Luhansk state administration building on April 27.) The Ukrainian government tried to respond with a hard line, with the new Interior Minister Arsen Avakov setting an April 11 deadline for separatists to evacuate government buildings. The deadline passed without incident because there was no one that the Ukrainian government could call on to eject the occupiers. The regional administration building in Kharkiv was surrendered quickly. In contrast, on April 12, gunmen seized government buildings around Donetsk, in a series of coordinated attacks. The police chief in Donetsk Oblast, Kostyantyn Pozhydayev, resigned at the demand of protesters.74

On April 13, the Ukrainian government declared an “Anti-Terrorist Operation” (ATO) in the eastern part of the country. This terminology was adopted to frame the action as a select targeting of “terrorists,” rather than the population or territory of eastern Ukraine. Acting President Turchynov recognized the delicacy of the situation: the government sought to reverse the separatist seizures without alienating the broader population, most of whom, it was assumed, did not support the separatists but would be alienated by a heavy-handed military intervention.

“The Donbass is in colossal danger. Besides the Russian special forces, besides terrorists, Donbass also has hundreds of people who have been deceived by Russian propaganda. And besides them are hundreds of thousands of completely innocent Ukrainians. That is why an anti-terrorist operation must be carried out responsibly.”75 Meanwhile the UN released a report saying that “Although there were some attacks against the ethnic Russian community, these were neither systematic nor widespread,” and pointing to “misinformed reports” and “greatly exaggerated stories of harassment of ethnic Russians by Ukrainian nationalist extremists.”76

The Ukrainian government was unprepared to address this challenge in the east for three reasons. First, the upper levels of the state security 73 The “Kharkov” referred to here is the Ukrainian region/city of Kharkiv. The separatists used the region’s Russian name.

services had been hollowed out and were yet to be rebuilt. Second, the lower level security forces in the region were both unsympathetic to the new government in Kyiv and were likely disoriented by the rapidly shifting chain of command. Many supported the separatists or stood aside. Third, some eastern Ukrainian elites supported the separatist efforts, increasing the legitimacy of separatists, and raising the level of force that would be needed to retake seized buildings. Had the Kyiv government used violence against the occupiers, it would likely have escalated the conflict, just as had happened when Yanukovych used force against the protesters in Kyiv. Finally, the Ukrainian armed forces were utterly incapable of addressing the situation. At the time the conflict started, the Ukrainian military had no units stationed east of the Dnipro river that could be deployed to combat separatists before they became entrenched.77

Russia’s Diplomatic Offensive

Accompanying events on the ground, the Russian government under-took a massive diplomatic and public relations campaign in support of its intervention in Ukraine. The main themes were four-fold.

First was a disinformation campaign aimed at denying the role of Russian forces in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Second was an effort to delegitimize the new regime in Kyiv by questioning the way it came to power and by repeatedly exaggerating the role of what it called “fascists”

in the Maidan movement and the new government. This was part of a broader campaign in Russia to link the war in Ukraine to World War II.78

Third, arguments that Crimea and eastern Ukraine were “really” Russian, which Russian nationalists had argued for years, were now widely disseminated in the government-controlled press and by Russian leaders.

Fourth, a series of charges of western hypocrisy were used to put the West on the defensive and to counteract the obvious violation of 77 Interviews with Leonid Polyakov, and Viktor Hvozd, Kyiv, May 2018. Polyakov was the deputy defense minister in the interim government (March‒May 2015), and Hvozd was a former chief of military intelligence who served as head of the Foreign Intelligence Service in the interim government. The incapacity of the Ukrainian armed forces, which began the post-Soviet era with 700,000 forces and an enormous arsenal, is a part of this story that has received insufficient attention.

international law. Central to this strategy was the argument that Russia’s seizure of Ukraine was no different than the West’s support for Kosovo’s independence.

All of these arguments were articulated by Putin in a marathon phone-in performance on April 18.79 He called the events in Kyiv “an unconstitutional coup, an armed seizure of power.” He then accused the new government of wanting “to invalidate some of the ethnic minorities’

rights, including the rights of the Russian minority.” Similarly, asked about his decision making on Crimea, he started by saying that “the Russian speaking population was threatened” and that “[t]his is what made Crimean residents, the people who live there, think about their future and ask Russia for help. This is what guided our decision.” He insisted that “There are no Russian units in eastern Ukraine ‒ no special services, no tactical advisers. All this is being done by the local residents.” On Crimea, he stated that “Certainly, Sevastopol is a city of Russian naval glory, which every Russian citizen knows. We will be guided by this understanding.” He stressed that the population of Crimea was essentially Russian, and that the results of the referendum there “gave us no other choice.” He insisted that the souring of relations with the United States was not Russia’s fault, but that of US “double-standards:”

We see a situation in which it’s appropriate to act the way the United States did in Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya but it’s inappropriate for Russia to defend its interests. I gave you the example of Kosovo, which is totally obvious and clear to the average person not involved in politics. Everything is being turned upside down. This position is devoid of any logic, any logic whatsoever.

The one exception to this overall line was Putin’s acknowledgement that the “little green men” in Crimea were in fact Russian soldiers.

In a speech in March, Putin laid out in systematic detail his justification for seizing Crimea, making many of the same points.80 He pointed to historical ties, Russian military battles, and the ethnic and linguistic makeup of the population. He also presented the transfer of Crimea and

“large sections of historical the South of Russia” to Ukraine as illegitimate decisions which became more consequential when “[u]nfortunately, the impossible became a reality. The USSR fell apart.” “It was only when Crimea ended up as part of a different country that Russia realized that it 79 Quotations in this paragraph are from “Kremlin Text of Russian Leader Vladimir Putin’s Phone-in,” BBC Monitoring Former Soviet Union, April 18, 2014.

was not simply robbed, it was plundered.” He then turned to an attack on the protests and the ouster of Yanukovych, calling the new government the “ideological heirs of Bandera, Hitler’s accomplice during World War II.” With relish, he quoted a statement that the United States made regarding Kosovo in 2009: “‘Declarations of independence may, and often do, violate domestic legislation. However, this does not make them violations of international law.’ End of quote. They wrote this, disseminated it all over the world, had everyone agree and now they are outraged.

Over what?” He then compared Crimea’s joining Russia to the United States’ independence from Britain and to the unification of Germany.

None of these arguments contradicted the fact that the seizure of Crimea was a blatant violation of international law, but that was beside the point.

This set of arguments was very influential, overlapping as it did arguments made by some western elites, many of whom had criticized NATO

expansion, the US war in Iraq, and the bombing of Yugoslavia. Many analysts blamed the conflict on the West in terms similar to those used by Putin.

Attempts at Conflict Resolution

In April, the first international effort to resolve the crisis in eastern Ukraine took place when diplomats from Ukraine, Russia, the European Union, and the United States met in Geneva. The four sides released a

“Joint Statement” specifying several steps to be taken to deescalate the conflict, including:

“All sides must refrain from any violence, intimidation or provocative actions.”

“All illegal armed groups must be disarmed; all illegally seized buildings must be returned to legitimate owners; all illegally occupied streets, squares and other public places in Ukrainian cities and towns must be vacated.”

“Amnesty will be granted to protesters and to those who have left buildings and other public places and surrendered weapons, with the exception of those found guilty of capital crimes.”

“The announced constitutional process will be inclusive, transparent and accountable. It will include the immediate establishment of a broad national dialogue.”

“It was agreed that the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission should play a leading role in assisting Ukrainian authorities and local communities in the immediate implementation of these de-escalation measures wherever they are needed most, beginning in the coming days.

238

The U.S., E.U. and Russia commit to support this mission, including by providing monitors.”81

For Russia, the Geneva agreement accomplished three important goals.

First, in Russia’s interpretation, it committed the Ukrainian government to refraining from the use of force against the separatists. Second, it intervened in Ukraine’s constitutional process, where Russia strongly supported decentralization. Third, it dealt with the crisis as an internal Ukrainian conflict ‒ Russia itself took on no obligations.82 An additional benefit was that it made no mention of Crimea. Ukraine also saw some advantages. The signing of the agreement represented a de facto Russian recognition of the new Ukrainian government, and Ukraine was able to show that it was serious about resolving the conflict peacefully.

Ukraine’s interim leadership quickly moved to promise a “comprehensive constitutional reform that will secure powers of the regions,”83 and initiated a ceasefire to allow the Geneva agreement time to take effect.

However, separatist leaders, who did not take part in the Geneva process, quickly rejected the deal. Separatist leader Denis Pushilin argued that the Geneva agreement’s stipulation that occupied buildings be vacated applied also to the government buildings in Kyiv in which the new government was working. “They must free the seized administrative buildings [in Kiev] and disarm the illegal armed formations, the national guard and the Right Sector, and free political prisoners.” This case demonstrated the flexibility in Russia’s position: it could appear to play a constructive role in negotiations, only to have the forces it supported in Ukraine reject what it had agreed to. On April 21, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov accused Ukraine of violating the Geneva agreement:

“The Geneva accord is not only not being fulfilled, but steps are being taken, primarily by those who seized power in Kiev, that are grossly breaching the agreements reached in Geneva.”84 The different sides’

positions appeared incompatible, and since the battle on the ground was increasingly being won by Russia’s allies, they had little incentive 81 “Joint Geneva Statement on Ukraine from April 17: The Full Text,” Washington Post, April 17, 2014.

to make any concessions. The Ukrainian government, meanwhile, was struggling to mount a response from its security services.

Ukraine Holds Elections

Amidst this burgeoning war, Ukraine held presidential elections in May and parliamentary elections in October to replace the interim president appointed in February and the parliament that had been elected under Yanukovych in 2012. In Crimea, no voting was possible, and while the government tried to hold elections in as much of the Donbas as possible, voting was impossible in some areas and turnout dramatically depressed more broadly in the east.85 The presidential vote was decisive: Petro Poroshenko, a chocolate magnate who had supported Yushchenko in 2004, then been a minister under Yanukovych, then became an early supporter of anti-Yanukovych protests, was elected decisively, winning 54.7 percent of the vote in the first round, the first time since 1991 a presidential election had been decided without a runoff. Poroshenko’s victory was facilitated by the decision of another popular opposition figure, Vitaliy Klitschko, to run for mayor of Kyiv instead.

Poroshenko called early parliamentary elections for October to try to consolidate his political support. Poroshenko’s bloc won the largest number of seats, with many wins in single-member districts compensating for a narrow defeat in the proportional representation ballot. Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk’s “People’s Front” edged the Poroshenko bloc with just over 22 percent of the PR ballot, but ended up with far fewer seats. These results dramatically transformed Ukraine’s parliament. The Party of Regions, which had dominated the previous parliament and been a major player since 2002, was gone, with its improvised replacement, the Opposition Bloc having won only 29 seats, compared with the Party of Regions’ 185 in 2012.

Poroshenko’s power was reinforced, though his bloc’s 132 seats left him needing to form a coalition to hold a majority (Table 7.1). The subsequent coalition included the Poroshenko Bloc, Narodnyi Front, Samopomich, Batkivshchyna, and the Radical Party, as well as some independents.

While the coalition was never fully in Poroshenko’s control, the new majority represented the victory of the pro-western forces that Russia feared. The coalition agreement included EU integration, revocation of

“non-bloc” status, and membership in NATO.86

The Conflict Grows

Through April and May 2014, separatists supported by Russia fought battles against the Ukrainian government, which was supported by paramilitary groups, in towns and cities throughout eastern Ukraine.

Separatist forces gradually expanded islands of control into contiguous areas and sought to expand the areas of control. In several cities, however, local opposition successfully contested them for power. In Mariupol, on the Black Sea Coast, separatists seized control but were then defeated by Ukrainian forces supported by paramilitaries. In Kharkiv, the people who seized the state administration building left within a few days, and while demonstrations for and against the government in Kyiv and separatism proceeded through the summer and fall of 2014, Kharkiv never came under the control of separatist forces. Apparently there was both less support for separatism and more support for the new government, both among elites and the populace.

There were some efforts taken to extend the secessionist movements beyond Crimea and the Donbas. Throughout the spring of 2014, Putin had used the term “Novorossiya,” which in the nineteenth century referred to a wide swath of territory that in 2014 comprised much of eastern and southern Ukraine, including the large Black Sea port of 86 Tadeusz A. Olszański, “The Ukrainian Coalition Agreement,” Ośrodek Studiów Wschodnich, November 14, 2014.

The Conflict Grows

241

Odesa, which like Crimea had been seized in the 1780s and had a large Russian-speaking population.87

On May 2, pro- and anti-Maidan protesters in Odesa clashed violently.

Anti-Maidan protesters, outnumbered, retreated to the Trade Union Building, which caught fire and burned, killing forty-two anti-Maidan activists. Four other anti-Maidan activists, as well as two pro-Maidan activists, were killed in the related fighting.88 Surprisingly, this event, one of the most violent so far in the crisis, did not lead to further escalation in Odesa. Instead, local leaders managed to deescalate the conflict, and stability returned.

On May 11, Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LNR) leaders held a referendum on autonomy for the areas they controlled, the results of which were almost certainly falsified. The following day, the separatists declared the independence of the DNR, and the Supreme Council of the DNR appointed Alexander Borodai, a Russian citizen, as prime minister. Igor Girkin (also known as “Strelkov”), a Russian former army and FSB (Federal Security Service, successor to the KGB) officer, declared himself “Supreme Commander” of the DNR, vowed that any Ukrainian forces remaining in the region would be destroyed, and requested military support from Russia. Both Borodai and Girkin had participated in the separatist movement in Moldova in the 1990s, and both had been directly involved in the annexation of Crimea, Girkin by leading troops and Borodai as an advisor to Sergei Aksyonov. While the Russian government claimed that these individuals were acting on their own, the fact that movement’s leaders came from Russia undermined the argument that this was an internal Ukrainian uprising, and Borodai was replaced with Alexander Zakharchenko in August 2014.

The DNR’s declaration of independence kicked off a more militarized phase of the conflict, as the focus spread from occupying specific buildings to securing the entire territory of Donetsk and Luhansk. This led to a series of attacks by separatist forces on facilities of the Ukrainian state, including a violent battle for control of Donetsk International Airport in late May.

As the fighting escalated and the Ukrainian government recovered from its original disarray, the scale of operations and weaponry deployed 87 See John O’Loughlin, Gerard Toal, and Vladimir Kolosov, “The Rise and Fall of

increased. At the same time, Russian involvement grew and became harder to hide. The separatists were increasingly armed with heavy weapons, including tanks, which came from Russia and in some cases originated in Crimea. In early June, Ukrainian attack aircraft were used against occupied state administration buildings in eastern Ukraine. The use of fighter aircraft, which the separatist forces did not have, had the potential to tip the military balance in favor of the Ukrainian government.

The air war escalated when a Ukrainian troop transport was shot down on approach to Luhansk, killing forty-nine people.

In late June, Ukraine declared a ceasefire to accompany a peace plan advanced by Poroshenko. The ceasefire lasted until July 1, when the government restarted attacks on separatist positions around Kramatorsk and Sloviansk in Donetsk oblast. This began a series of victories by Ukrainian forces that threatened the overall position of the separatist forces in Donetsk. In the coming weeks, several other positions fell to government forces. When shells landed inside Russia on July 14, Russia blamed Ukraine and said that the incident might prompt Russia to deploy aircraft against Ukraine, while Ukraine called the incident a provocation.

The West’s Response to the War in Eastern Ukraine

While the annexation of Crimea and Russian support for separatism in eastern Ukraine appalled and worried people across the western world, there was a wide range of opinion on how to respond. Many saw Russia’s actions both as a moral affront and as an act of aggression that needed to be met with a resolute response. People in this school of thought tended to think of the events of 2014 in the context of 1938, with the lesson being that aggressive dictators are better confronted sooner than later.

Many others, however, were inclined to come to a new accommodation with Russia. To those convinced that Russia’s claim to Crimea had some merit, and that Russia was an important economic power and a great power whose claims could never be ignored, escalating the conflict seemed unlikely to accomplish much.

While Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States preferred a resolute response, Germany was much more divided. Chancellor Angela Merkel, long a friend of Putin, had lost patience with him, but many other German elites were unwilling to forsake profitable trade relations, especially in energy, over Ukraine. In July, a lengthy analysis in Der Spiegel sought to explain why Germany seemed determined to maintain a “special relationship” with Russia. It pointed out that recent revelations of spying by the US National Security Agency on Merkel’s mobile phone

The West’s Response to the War in Eastern Ukraine 243

had soured opinion on the United States, feeding anti-Americanism that had already worsened under the George W. Bush administration.89

Sanctions on Russia were expected to have dramatically different impacts on different states, depending on their trade relations with Russia. In May, a leaked report from the European Commission warned that sanctions could remove a full percentage point from Germany’s GDP growth for 2014.90

In the US, opinion was much less divided. While several influential intellectuals blamed the West for the conflict and advocated a new accommodation with Russia, the vast majority of politicians from the two major parties joined to push for harsh sanctions.

Despite these differences, however, the European Union and United States repeatedly agreed to strengthen the sanctions regime in response to events in eastern Ukraine. On June 26, the European Commission signed the Association Agreement with Ukraine that had sparked the initial crisis the previous November. In early July, yet another set of sanctions was adopted by the European Union, and the United States cut off several Russian energy firms and banks from access to US financial markets. Eventually, most of the Russian energy, oil, and arms sectors were denied access to western capital markets. These sanctions went beyond the individuals targeted by the first round of sanctions to aim at key sectors and at leaders who were connected to the intervention in Ukraine.

Russia reacted to sanctions with defiance. Responding to the Obama administration’s extension of sanctions in July, Prime Minister Medvedev said “Sanctions are evil,” and warned that they would make matters worse, not better. Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin tweeted that “The sanctions imposed by Washington on Russian defense sector majors are unlawful and demonstrate that the U.S. is engaged in unfair competition on the arms market. Anyway, the Americans cannot put a lid on the ongoing re-arming of the Russian armed forces or shatter the export potential of our defense sector.” Putin himself said that sanctions “generally have a boomerang effect and, without a doubt, in this case, are driving the Russian-U.S. relations into a stalemate and seriously damaging them.”91 Analysts have debated how much sanctions have injured Putin and other targets, and whether they may even have 89 Markus Feldenkirchen, Christiane Hoffmann, and René Pfister, “Will It Be America or Russia?” Spiegel Online, July 10, 2014.

backfired.92 The sanctions that Russia enacted in response served to shield Russian producers from foreign competition, at the cost of higher prices to Russian consumers.

MH17: The Conflict Changes Course

On July 17, a Russian Buk surface-to-air missile shot down Malaysian Airlines flight 17 en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.93 Shooting down the airplane was almost certainly an accident, probably a case of mistaken identity in which the civilian aircraft was wrongly identified as a Ukrainian military plane, even though it was flying at over thirty thousand feet.

By spurring widespread outrage and undermining those who advocated conciliation, the downing of MH17 dramatically changed the course of the broader conflict between Russia and the West. In the West, people were angered not only at the killing of so many innocents, but by Russia’s cynicism in denying responsibility and by the rebels’ obstruction of the investigation. As a result, more people advocated sanctions against Russia, and fewer spoke openly against them. A week after the disaster, yet another new round of sanctions was announced.

The fighting continued to escalate throughout the summer. During the second half of July, as the diplomatic battle over responsibility for the tragedy raged, Ukrainian forces made progress in reducing the territory held by insurgents. The Ukrainian army had regrouped and, while it was still very flawed, it was augmented by paramilitary groups formed in part from the self-defense groups that had organized security on the Maidan.

While these paramilitaries tended to be highly motivated and in some 92 The impact of the sanctions is evaluated in Mikhail Alexseev and Henry Hale, “Crimea Come What May: Do Economic Sanctions Backfire Politically,” unpublished paper, 2018.

93 There has been, of course, extensive argumentation to the effect that Russia’s responsibility has not been proven, but all the credible sources that have examined the matter in depth reach that conclusion. Only the Russian government, which advanced a range of theories, has stuck with the assertion that Ukraine was responsible. In May 2018, an international “joint investigative team” stated that they had “legal and convincing evidence that would stand up in a courtroom” that the BUK missile system that shot down the plane came from Russia’s 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade, stationed at Kursk. See Shaun Walker, “MH17 Downed by Russian Military Missile System, Say Investigators,” The Guardian, May 24, 2018.

245

cases exhibited extraordinary bravery, they were neither well armed nor well trained, and command and control was weak. However, the separatists were also relatively poorly armed and trained, and the tide began to turn.

On August 20, Ukrainian government and paramilitary forces seized Ilovaisk, between the city of Donetsk and the Russian border, as part of an effort to separate Donetsk and Luhansk separatist forces and to disrupt supply lines. The Ukrainian government believed it was on the verge of a decisive victory, and apparently the Russian government agreed. An insurgent counterattack was bolstered by the entry into the conflict of regular Russian army forces crossing the nearby border. The Russian forces, well equipped and trained and with superior command, control, and intelligence, encircled a large group of Ukrainian forces. An attempt to relieve them was repulsed by Russian forces, and the Ukrainian forces were then routed, with many being taken prisoner.94

The Russian victory around Ilovaisk forced Russia to make a decision.

With regular Russian army units now in Ukraine (though Russia still denied this) Russia could push further into Ukraine, with a variety of strategic goals possible. A maximalist goal would be to aim all the way across southern Ukraine, not only forging a land link with Crimea but also seizing the entire Ukrainian Black Sea coast (landlocking Ukraine), taking Odesa, another coveted city, and establishing contact with Russia’s proxy republic in Transnistria. A more modest goal would have been to push through Mariupol, which had already seen a temporary takeover by separatist forces, to establish a land link with Crimea. The downside of such a strategy was that it would have turned a local proxy war into a general war between Russia and Ukraine, and destroyed the fiction that Russia was not involved.

Russia’s restraint in this episode is worth noting, as it demonstrates some limit to Putin’s appetite or his risk acceptance. To the extent that Putin’s rhetoric about reestablishing “Novorossiya” was serious, the events of the spring and summer of 2014 may have disabused him of the notion that it would be easy to accomplish. In most of eastern and southern Ukraine, pro-Russian movements had failed to catch on, undermining the widely held belief that all Russophone Ukrainians identified with Russia and wanted to join it. Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk were exceptions, not the rule, and even in those places, separatism relied decisively on Russian military support. By September it had become clear that in most regions of Ukraine, small bands of pro-Russian activists 94 The battle is described in Tim Judah, “Ukraine: A Catastrophic Defeat,” The New York Review of Books, September 5, 2014.

246

From Revolution to War, 2013–2015

supported by the Russian government could not spark a broader movement. If Russia wanted to create “Novorossiya,” it would need to invade on a large scale, and it was not willing to do this at that time.

From Geneva to Normandy to Minsk

The downing of MH17, along with the escalation of fighting and the involvement of Russian army forces around Ilovaisk, seemed to increase the desire on all sides to rein in the conflict. For Ukraine, the rout of its forces made it clear that Russia could thwart any attempt to win the war on the ground. While Ukrainian forces could take on the Donbas separatists, they could not defeat the Russian army. For Russia, the easy victory in Crimea had become much more dangerous in Donbas, because the myth of Russian noninvolvement would have to be surrendered to help the separatists succeed. Moreover, the shooting down of MH17 had galvanized western cohesion against Russia. For the West, the prospect of a broader war, either between Russia and Ukraine or perhaps against NATO weak points in the Baltics, caused a great deal of fear. Everyone now had reason to want to see the conflict deescalate.

However, various peace efforts had already been made, and had been stymied by the same set of problems. Not only were the different sides’

goals incompatible, but their understandings of who was at war, and therefore who should be negotiating, were equally incompatible.

On June 6, while leaders were gathered in Normandy to mark the seventieth anniversary of the D-Day landings, leaders from Ukraine, Russia, Germany, and France met to discuss the crisis. This meeting initiated what became known as the “Normandy format,” which was to become the main international forum to address the conflict. The shift from the Geneva process to that of Normandy was significant in that the new format did not include the United States. It made the process a European one, but appeared to shift the weight in Russia’s favor and to further the Russian goal of cleaving off the EU powers from the United States.

On June 20, Petro Poroshenko advanced a peace plan containing fifteen points. Putin offered general support for the plan, but insisted that the separatists be made party to the negotiations. This issue continued to divide the Russian and Ukrainian approaches. While Ukraine denied the legitimacy of the separatists and believed that Russia ought to negotiate because it was supporting them, Russia stuck by the notion that the separatists were an independent force and the Russia was not a party to the conflict.

From Geneva to Normandy to Minsk

247

By the end of August, having relieved pressure on its allies in the Donbas and sent a powerful signal that it would not allow Ukraine to achieve a military victory, Russia was willing to stabilize its gains.

Ukraine, in contrast, was reeling, and sought to do what it could to prevent the military disaster from expanding. Western governments were afraid yet again that a more general conflict might break out. This constellation of interests formed the underpinning of the first Minsk agreement, reached in September 2014.

The “Protocol on the Results of the Consultations of the Trilateral Contact Group,” known initially as the “Minsk Protocol” and later as

“Minsk-1,” was signed on September 8, 2014. The Normandy format was largely retained, though rather than German and French representatives, the OSCE was represented along with Russia and Ukraine (hence the group was called the “Trilateral contact group”).

The agreement achieved its immediate aim, which was to consolidate a decrease in the violence. But as with the Geneva statement, profound differences were papered over with vague language, and the two sides interpreted the agreement completely differently. The agreement contained twelve points, the first of which was the “immediate bilateral cessation of the use of weapons.” The third addressed decentralization of power in Ukraine, referring to “certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.” The ninth point required “the holding of early local elections in accordance with the Law of Ukraine ‘With respect to the temporary status of local self-government in certain areas of the Donetsk and the Lugansk regions.’” Item 10 was “Remove unlawful military formations, military hardware, as well as militants and mercenaries from the territory of Ukraine.” Significantly, the agreement was signed not only by representatives of Russia and Ukraine, but by representatives of the DNR (Aleksander Zakharchenko) and LNR (Igor Plotnitsky). This achieved another Russian goal, having Ukraine recognize the leaders of the separatist republics at the bargaining table.

This formula, which remained as the reference point for discussions of a resolution in the coming months and years, offered something for everyone, but reflected deep contradictions in the sides’ positions rather than resolving them. The timing for “early” elections was obviously vague, but the bigger question was whether they would occur before or after other steps, such as “permanent monitoring of the Ukrainian-Russian state border … by the OSCE” (item 4). In the coming years, Ukraine insisted that Russia follow provision 10 (“remove unlawful military formations”) while Russia denied their existence. Russia insisted on implementing decentralization of power, to which many Ukrainians were resolutely opposed and others saw as a final step, not a first one.

248

From Revolution to War, 2013–2015

The Battle for Debaltseve and Minsk-2

The signing of the Minsk agreement was a result, rather than a cause, of the slowdown in the fighting that both sides sought after the battle of Ilovaisk. By January 2015, however, strategic considerations led to a new escalation. The subject of renewed large-scale fighting was the town of Debaltseve, to the northeast of the city of Donetsk. The area comprised a government-controlled salient, largely surrounded by separatist-held territory, as well as the symbolically important Donetsk International Airport. It was significant as a junction of roads and railroads, and hence was important for the lines of communications of both sides. On January 22, separatists renewed a large-scale attack to seize the salient. The battle continued for several weeks, with artillery and rocket attacks razing the city and civilians struggling to escape the fighting. By February 10, the separatists had nearly cut off the government forces by seizing the main road out of the salient. They were determined to maximize the extent of their gains before the Minsk-2 agreement stabilized new lines of control.

The separatists continued their assault even after a new ceasefire agreement was reached on February 12. Finally, on February 18, Ukrainian forces began to withdraw from their unsustainable position in the city. As in Ilovaisk the previous summer, the result was a disaster for Ukrainian forces, many of whom were killed or captured, despite the ceasefire.

The fighting around Debaltseve demonstrated that the Minsk Protocol of 2014 was a shambles. Despite that failure, the parties put the same process into effect in February 2015. On February 7, Germany’s Angela Merkel and France’s Francois Hollande developed a new plan after consulting with Poroshenko and Putin. The US government was discussing shipping arms to the Ukrainian government, which Hollande and Merkel feared would lead to an escalation of the conflict. As was the case before, Ukraine had an incentive to do anything that would limit the rout of its troops, while Russia was willing to see its latest gains recognized in an agreement. By avoiding the trickiest issues, such as demarcating control of Debaltseve, where lines of control were unclear as the agreement was being drafted, the process strengthened the incentive for both sides to fight more intensely, not less, as a ceasefire approached.

The agreement reached was technically called the “Package of Measures for the Implementation of the Minsk Agreements,” but is generally known as Minsk-2. The plan established what its authors hoped was a set of steps that would resolve the conflict. Major provisions among the plan’s thirteen points included withdrawal of “foreign armed formations,” the holding of local elections, “decentralization” in Ukraine, and the reestablishment of Ukraine’s control over its borders. There

were numerous problems. Russia was still denying that it had “foreign armed formations” in Ukraine, so implementing that crucial measure would be difficult. Equally problematic was the timing of the proposed steps. If local elections were held before the territory was returned to Ukraine’s control and in the absence of strong international oversight, Ukraine would regard them as rigged. Ukraine committed to “decentralization,” but it was not clear exactly what this meant. Greater autonomy at the level of the oblast, which is what it seemed to mean, would require amending the constitution, and opposition to such a move in Ukraine was high.

As in the case of Minsk-1, Minsk-2 served the immediate needs of the various parties, but established a road map for the future which could not actually be followed. The proposal for greater regional autonomy was seen as a “poison pill” for Ukraine. It would make Ukraine responsible for rebuilding the devastated regions, while giving the regions (and by extension, it appears, Russia) a veto over Ukraine’s future reform and international orientation. Russia and the separatists had little interest in the withdrawal of Russian forces or in reestablishing Ukraine’s control over the border. Each side expected that the commitments it favored were nonnegotiable, while seeking to avoid the commitments that it found unacceptable. The result was an agreement that could not be implemented, but also could not be abandoned. The good news was that fighting again ebbed; the bad news was that there was no path to ending the violence altogether. Since Minsk-2, the conflict in Donbas continued, and while the territorial lines of control stabilized (see Map 7.2), a steady stream of casualties ensued. By 2018 total casualties had surpassed ten thousand and the threat of a reescalation to all-out fighting was constant.

Conclusion

While disagreement over Ukraine’s status had been growing for years, within Ukraine, between Russia and Ukraine, and between Russia and the West, few foresaw, even in the fall of 2013, that Ukraine would experience a “revolution” over the matter in early 2014. Similarly, even as protests in Kyiv reached a peak in February 2014, very few anticipated that Russia would seize Crimea and intervene in eastern Ukraine in support of separatist movements. That these events were so shocking suggests that until the moment it broke out, conflict was not inevitable.

Both within Ukraine and internationally, matters that had festered for years came to a head. The possibility that one side might win the battle permanently prompted those on the other to raise the stakes. Within

Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych’s efforts to irreversibly consolidate his power prompted protesters first to try to get him to change course, and then to try to eject him from power. Between Ukraine, Russia, and the West, the possibility that Yanukovych’s ouster would permanently reorient Ukraine toward the West seems to have convinced Putin that there was little to lose, and perhaps much to gain, in seizing territory that Russia had long claimed.

The source of escalation within Ukraine after 2010 was Viktor Yanukovych’s effort to concentrate power and introduce a more authoritarian model. Yanukovych had been elected fairly in 2010, but he sought to ensure that he would not face a fair election in 2015, and he had already done a great deal to eliminate political competition in the country and to control

Conclusion

aggrandizement was bound to generate three different kinds of resentment: one from those who supported democracy over his autocracy; a second from those who supported a pro-European line against the pro-Russian line that seemed to follow naturally from autocracy; and a third from economic elites whose wealth was threatened by Yanukovych’s greed. The decision not to sign the AA spurred protest, but it was only Yanukovych’s response to the protests that moved the situation toward a potential revolution. Repression and violence was sufficient to anger protesters and broaden their support, but not to impede the protests’

growth. This caused the cycle to escalate until Yanukovych’s allies began deserting him and he fled.

A second conflict was between Ukraine and Russia. While Viktor Yanukovych sought Russia’s help in establishing his domestic hegemony, he did not seek to become a vassal of Russia. Instead, he sought to gain both the domestic political and economic benefits of an Association Agreement with the European Union and the benefits, including less expensive energy, from a positive relationship with Russia. These goals were incompatible for both technical and political reasons. Technically, the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) envisioned with the European Union was incompatible with the Customs Union envisioned by Russia. Politically, Putin was not willing to countenance a closer relationship between Ukraine and the EU. As he made clear in the fall of 2013, Putin would seek to create an economic crisis for Ukraine, and a political crisis for Yanukovych, if the Association Agreement went ahead.

Putin saw the AA as threatening the permanent loss of Ukraine, which Russia had, since 1991, seen as artificial and temporary. This compelled Yanukovych to take the steps that kicked off the protests. It also meant that Russia refused to accept the outcome of the protests, deploying military force against Ukraine rather than accepting a political defeat.

The third conflict was between the West and Russia. Both the European Union and Russia misunderstood how serious the other was about Ukraine. The European Union underestimated how determined Putin was to keep Ukraine in Russia’s orbit, while Putin underestimated how determined the European Union was to defend the principle that no external state could have a veto on the EU’s relations with a third country. The EU’s principle that no one, not even Russia, could veto another state’s relations with the European Union clashed directly with Russia’s insistence that as a great power it had a veto over European security affairs and that it had a sphere of influence in its immediate neighborhood. While the European Union did not perceive its expanded relationship with Ukraine as aimed against Russia, it became less willing over time to sacrifice its relationship with Ukraine to placate Russia.

From Revolution to War, 2013–2015

These three conflicts were distinct from each other in theory, but by the fall of 2013 they had become largely intertwined. Ukraine’s domestic order was tightly connected to how it would relate to Russia ‒ a more democratic Ukraine would also be a less pro-Russian one. And both questions became connected to the growing tension between the West and Russia. Well before 2013, some observers had pointed to a new cold war. Whether that rhetoric was warranted or not, the tension between an increasingly authoritarian Russia and a western Europe built around EU

norms had grown dramatically, and Ukraine was seen as a territory that would likely soon land in one camp or the other. The status quo in Ukraine was increasingly shaky, and both Russia and the European Union sought to see that Ukraine ended up on its side of the line that was increasingly dividing Europe.

As we have shown in detail in this chapter, the period of the Euromaidan or “Revolution of Dignity,” from late November 2013 until February 22, 2014, was one in which small decisions had magnified and often unpredictable effects. An initial decision to beat protesters on November 30 led to a huge escalation in the protest movement. The passage of “dictatorship laws” in mid-January revived an ebbing protest movement. Clashes between protesters and security forces on February 18 and 20 fractured Yanukovych’s loyalists. The decision by protesters to reject a deal negotiated between EU and Russian diplomats, party leaders, and Yanukovych was predicted to lead to harsh repression.

Instead, the regime collapsed within hours.

While the course of the protests was impossible to predict, the effect of the results seemed clear: Ukraine was going to turn toward Europe. Putin responded by invading and annexing Crimea and by fomenting a rebellion in eastern Ukraine. The alternative for Putin, it seemed, was to accept the loss of Ukraine. Clearly, he could have chosen to do that, and Russia had made treaty commitments to that effect. He chose instead to seize the unique opportunity that presented itself to seize Crimea and to make a bid for a much larger part of Ukraine. Whether in supporting separatists in eastern Ukraine he hoped to repeat the Crimea scenario, or whether he intended to create the ongoing instability that has resulted, we do not know.
